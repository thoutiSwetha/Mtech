PaaS is defined as a platform for the creation of on-demand applications or software, delivered over the web. In other words, PaaS is the cloud where the development tools are hosted, which can then be accessed by the end user through a web browser. As an application or software provider, PaaS provides the computing platform on which to develop and deploy cloud hosted applications with relative ease
If you have been thinking about using PaaS, but need a better understanding of the benefits and drawbacks, here are some points that can help you decide.
Benefits of PaaS
•	Quick testing and deployment: With PaaS, development teams can try different configurations, multiple machines and different locations, to run stress tests and assess performance, compatibility, and response in ways that are impossible in a local environment. With quick testing of applications, deployment too becomes faster.
•	Dynamic allocation: In today’s competitive market, IT teams need to have the flexibility to quickly test and put a new feature of an application or a new service on the market; or test these on a small section of clients before making them available to the entire world. With PaaS and cloud computing, such tasks have now become possible.
•	Increased focus on business and boost to internal entrepreneurship: As companies no longer need to expend effort on the maintenance and choice of systems, they can focus more on their core business. With PaaS, quicker development and deployment of infrastructure on line is possible, which in turn can empower visionaries and give internal entrepreneurship a boost. After all, by setting aside a specific sum under the cloud budget, companies can let their IT teams experiment with cloud computing resources, and see what innovative ideas they can come up with.
Drawbacks of PaaS
•	Data security: As with other cloud computing solutions, many companies still have low confidence in the level of data security offered by PaaS. Many businesses are still skeptical about having their applications hosted by a third party, while some enterprises and government clients need to be assured of compliance with all applicable regulations concerning security, privacy, and data retention before they decide in favor of PaaS services.
•	Limited flexibility: PaaS solutions can’t match the flexibility of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) offerings. Unlike their IaaS counterparts, PaaS customers cannot necessarily create and delete multiple virtual machines easily. In addition, when compared to SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings, PaaS falls short as it doesn’t represent a complete product in the way that SaaS does. So, a company still needs to put in development effort to design, create, and test programs before they are deployed for the end users.
•	Customer captivity: With a limited number of PaaS vendors in the market today, each of which wants to build a binding relationship through its comprehensive offerings, a vendor lock-in period is often the norm, which can limit the client’s choices.
•	Problems of integration with in-house systems and applications: Integration of PaaS services with the rest of your systems and applications could trigger an increase in complexity.
As a developer of web-based applications or software, PaaS is a great solution to decrease initial startup cost for infrastructure and ensure that you are in a good position to be flexible and expand quickly.  If the drawbacks are addressed properly, PaaS has great potential to gain ground in the market
